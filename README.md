# Numpy Image Preview

Numpy Image Preview is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to preview in image and inspect NumPy (.npy) data files directly within the VS Code environment.

## Features

- **Npy File Preview**: Open any .npy file in your workspace and the extension will display the file's metadata and visualize the data either an RGBA image or a grayscale image.
- **Metadata Display**: The extension shows the shape, data type, and value bound of the NumPy array stored in the .npy file.
- **Batch Data Support**: You can easily slide the index bar to check any single image in your batched data.

## Usage

Open any .npy file in your VS Code workspace, then you will see the image view of it!
